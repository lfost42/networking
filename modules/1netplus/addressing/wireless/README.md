## Troubleshoot a Wireless Connection

At a local library, the librarian learns that a patron is unable to access the internet on one of the laptops. All the computers are configured with DHCP IP addressing except for the wireless user on Laptop1, who is complaining that www.cisco.pka cannot be reached. Identify and resolve the issue, then verify the resolution.

### Notes

This exercise takes you step-by-step in resolving the issue. The follow-up questions expected me to run a tracert or ping but I just ran an ipconfig /all on a working host to determine the default gateway ip address. 

I expected the router credentials to not be default but I figured if it wasn't the default the lab would have told me. It took me a hot minute to accept that though!
