## Use Documentation to Solve Issues

In this activity, you will use the documentation that you created in the Packet Tracer - Troubleshooting Challenge - Document the Network activity to guide network troubleshooting efforts.

It has been discovered that the network that you worked with in the previous PT activity has developed communication problems. Some hosts are unable to ping other hosts and the internet server. It is your job to determine what the issues are and to locate and repair them.

Network issues could exist in any device. Be sure to check for comprehensive errors:

=   Addressing configuration  
=   Interface activation  
=   Routing  
=   NAT

### Walkthrough

Passwords for all devices are VTY: cisco, Enable secret: class

### Part 1: Assess Connectivity

All hosts should be able to ping each other and the internet server. Determine if this requirement is met. If not, identify which hosts and networks should be further investigated.

### Part 2: Access Network Devices

From the hosts which have communication problems, use ICMP tools to determine where in the network these problems may be located. From the host PCs, access devices in the network and display configurations and operational status.

### Part 3: Repair the Network

After locating the issues, reconfigure the devices to repair the connectivity problem. Use your documentation from the previous activity to help you.

### Part 4: Document the Issues

Record your issues in the table below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device | Issue | Action |
|     |     |     |
|     |     |     |
|     |     |     |
|     |     |     |
