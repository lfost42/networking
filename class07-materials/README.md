Hey @everyone

Thank you for dipping your toes into the world of networking! This can be super overwhelming stuff, but we will take it in stride and get in lots of practice. No need to be 100% ready to throw yourself into it all! We'll work up the nerve, strategy, and techniques to get there over the next few classes and we'll find things that work for you!
