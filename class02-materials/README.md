Hey @everyone 

Thank you for a great second class! Hope you had some fun diving into HTML!

Also, today is the first day a lot of you have ever touched code. Please give yourself some breathing room and a little bit of grace. We'll get plenty of practice in on Sunday and throughout the coming weeks. 

We are going to work hard over the weekend to button up Discord and make it work better for the number of folx we have joining us, so please give us a little time to stop the torrent and find what works best 🙂 Also, working on getting the slides working again!
